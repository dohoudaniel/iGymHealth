# App Design

The components and libraries used in this app are used
together to bring the desired results.

## API

The plan for the API is to use a free API to search for results
and bring them to the user without leaving the app.

## Offline & Online Features

The app should be able to handle the connectivity issues and only
activate some features when the online/offline condition is triggered.

Online Features include:
- Sync with online database.
- Search for exercises & nutritient diets.

Offline Features include:
- Sync with local database.
- Save workout records.
- Setup nutritient diets.
- Track progress or streak.

## Save Favorites

The app should allow the user to save favorite articles on a local database
which in turn can be synchronised to the cloud.
